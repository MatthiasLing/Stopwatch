# Stopwatch

Created by Matthias Ling 


This stopwatch is designed to be efficient and elegant, as well as easy to use and understand. 

Its purpose is to track a user's location with simultaneously corresponding timings.

# Build Instructions:

• Retrieve stopwatch folder from GitHub/Google Drive, unzip and move to desktop or other location

• Open the stopwatch.html file from within the Stopwatch folder, the application should open in the web browser

• Please accept the location permissions prompt when it pops up - this will occur on loading and otherwise through requesting it via the button.

As I have displayed the latitude before longitude on the main screen, the table also displays latitude first, although the columns are not explicitly labeled.  I thought this as acceptable because the table would reflect the displayed coordinates already and thus there would be no need to specify which was which twice.
